        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

        <p>
          I have a deep passion for software engineering and I’m always amazed by the things accomplished by teams that
          are part
          of this craft. From feats such as building a simple mobile or web application, to building software systems
          used to
          power an entire spacecraft. I'm always up for joining such amazing teams.
          I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in computer science, information
          technology, and the services industry. Skilled in JavaScript, React, Node.js, SASS, and Github. Strong
          engineering
          professional with a Bachelor’s Degree focused in Information Technology from Mount Kenya University.

            <ul>
              <li>Built an improved version of a modal that better captured the details of a mentorship request and made
                it possible for
                mentees to become mentors. The modal had additional checkboxes and input fields.</li>
              <li>Performed a progressive phasing out of Bootstrap CSS in favor of SCSS to make the app lean and provide
                a greater degree
                of development control.</li>
              <li>Cleaned up SQL queries by removing unnecessary joins from older REST API endpoint implementations and
                thus making
                subsequent database(PostgreSQL) reads faster.</li>

            <p>Summary</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a responsive modal for a React.js internal admin dashboard, used to capture and send form data
                to a REST API
                which communicated with various microservices as part of a larger architecture.</li>
              <li>The initial implementation of the form used multiple `useState` hooks to capture data, I migrated this
                state
                management to a single `useReducer` hook to remove clutter in the code brought about by this.</li>
              <li>Increased coverage of end-to-end tests for the admin dashboard leveraging the Cypress library and
                integration tests
                leveraging React-Testing Library.</li>

            <p>Summary</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implemented design templates for a customer dashboard generated using Invision which included
                multi-step forms with
                modals and charts used to capture client configuration data for the iOS, Android and Typescript SDKs.
              </li>
              <li>Used SCSS and Pug template engine for the styling and markup and HighCharts library for implementing
                the chart views.</li>
              <li>Built a Typescript SDK that mirrored our iOS and Android SDKs to achieve reachability on Web app
                clients. Also leveraged
                the TypeDocs library to render HTML documentation for the SDK which I eventually uploaded to an Amazon
                S3 bucket for
                easy access.</li>
